DIRECTIONS

1. Roll the basic sugar cookie dough into tablespoon-size balls and place on baking sheets (do not substitute slice-and-bake dough).
2. Make a well in each ball with your thumb. Fill the wells with a total of 1⁄3 cup apricot jam or raspberry jam.
3. Bake at 350° F on parchment-lined baking sheets until just beginning to brown, 15 to 18 minutes.
4. Cool slightly on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
